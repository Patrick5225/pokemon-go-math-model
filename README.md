# Pok√©mon Go: Case Study in Mathematical Modeling
This is a research project created in a group of 5 with students from Bakersfield College. The project focuses on building a more accurate mathematical model than other invalid and less accurate third-party models. We presented our project at the Joint Mathematics Meeting (JMM) of 2018 in San Diego, CA.

<b>Abstract:</b> Third-party models for pokemon and their move-sets in Pokemon Go, by Niantic, are well distributed but fundamentally flawed. Currently, the most accurate predictions are made by full simulations which disagree with the popular, third-party models. We present more accurate mathematical models and heuristics for pokemon, move-sets, and predicting winners of match-ups. Our results find agreement with simulations, where other models have not. We demonstrate these results and rankings based on theorems from game theory, calculus, basic algebra, and linear algebra.
